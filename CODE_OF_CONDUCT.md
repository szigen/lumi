# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including the GitHub
repository, issue tracker, pull requests, and discussions. It also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces, such as
using an official project email address or acting as an appointed representative
at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers
at **szigen@pm.me**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly
and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard
to the reporter of an incident.
